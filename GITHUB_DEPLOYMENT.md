# GitHub Deployment Instructions

## Token Issue
The GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable appears to be in a special format that's not directly compatible with GitHub's authentication system. It may be encrypted or encoded.

## Manual Deployment Steps

1. Generate a standard GitHub Personal Access Token:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Generate a new token with 'repo' scope

2. Use the token to push the repository:
   - git remote set-url origin https://USERNAME:TOKEN@github.com/USERNAME/ultimate-sports-arena.git
   - git push -u origin master

3. Alternative: Clone and push
   - Clone a fresh copy of the repository
   - Copy all files from the current project
   - Commit and push with the new token
